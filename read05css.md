## CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users, (how they are styled, laid out, etc.).

It is a rule based language. 

It opens with a selector, then curly braces. Inside the braces are one or more declarations (property or value pairs)

CSS Modules are basically groups of similar features (ex. Backgrounds and Borders)

CSS Specifications are updated constantly but ar always designed to allow older CSS to continue working. 

There are 3 ways to add CSS: 
- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS

External CSS can chhange the look of a website by changing just one file.

Internal CSS may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. 

Inline CSS applies a unique style for a single element. 

All the styles have a "Cascading Order" according to the following hierarchy:
1. Inline Style (inside an HTML element)
2. External and Internal Style Sheets
3. Browser Default
