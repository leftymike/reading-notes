# Git Tutorial

### Version Control allows you to revisit versions of a file by recording changes. One can revert to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By using a VCS, mistakes in files can be easily rectified.

Local Version Control System was created many years ago and entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to your files.

A Centralized Version Control System entails a single server storing all changes and file versions and can be accessed by various clients. 

A Distributed Version Control System allows clients to create mirrored repositories. It also allows various ways to collaborate and enables the use of various simultaneous workflows. 

### Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of "snapshots". 
Every save (commit) creates a snapshot. 
Files in Git remain in 3 main states (committed, modified, or staged).
