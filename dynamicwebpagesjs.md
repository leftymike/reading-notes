<h1> Dynamic Web Pages with Javascript </h1>

Javascript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages. It allows you to store useful values inside variables. 

<b> Dynamic </b> is used to describe both client-side Javascript and server side language. A webpage with no dynamically updating content is referred to as static (same content all the time).

<h2> Apply Javascript with the (script) element </h2>
<ul> Using "var", "let", "const" </ul>

<b> Variables </b> are containers for storing data (values). Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. Java script identifiers are case sensitive.

In Javascript, the = sign is an assignment operator, not an "equal to" operator. 
Javascript Data Type variables can hold numbers and text values. Text values are called strings.

<h2> Declaring (Creating) Javascript Variables </h2>
You declare with "var". To assign a value to the variable use the = sign. You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it. You can also assign a value with the variable when you declare it. You can declare many variables in on statement.
