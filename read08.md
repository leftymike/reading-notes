# Loops

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. Loops repeat an action some number of times (even zero). 

### Types of loops-
for, do...while, while, labeled, break, continue, for...in, for...of, are all types of loops.

The for statement (loop) repeats until a specified condition evaluates to falsem(looks as follows).

for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
   statement

The while statement (loop) executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true (looks as follows).

while (condition)
   statement

If the condition becomes false, statement with the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
