# Programming with Javascript

### Expressions and Operators
Javascript has binary and unary operators and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. I binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator. Unary operators require a single operand either before or after the operator. 


### Functions are the Fundamental Building Blocks of Javascript
A function in Javascript is similar to a procedure, a set of statements that perform a task or calculates a value. For a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is an obvious relationship between the input and the output. 

#### Function defintion-
Consists of function keyword followed by: (name of function, list of parameters in parenthesis, separated by commas) and Javascript statements that define in curly brackets {}.

## Control Flow-
Is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line to the last line unless the computer runs across something that structures that change the control flow (such as conditional and loops [if..else])
Control flow means you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structureand how it affects order of execution.

### Javascript Functions-
A block of code designed to perform a particular task. A function is performed when "something" invokes it (calls it).A function is defined with the "function" keyword, followed by a name, followed by parenthesis.
